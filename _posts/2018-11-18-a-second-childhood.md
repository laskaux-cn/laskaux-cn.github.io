title: A Second Childhood
---
For a while I’ve been finding myself younger than I look, sometimes almost a schoolboy:

I’m curious about how a sewing machine stitches, how a horn pitches, and how a Space Shuttle lands. 

I’m learning to better convey my thoughts and feelings in the language I speak every day. 

I feel more at ease reading a history book with a dictionary, but often forget the names of those ancient heroes and cities one week later.

Until a few months ago, I couldn’t tell a hyphen, an en dash, and an em dash apart.

I’m puzzled by a new foreign language—why there have to be more tenses than what seems necessary.
