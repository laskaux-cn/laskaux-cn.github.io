title: A Second Childhood
---
For a while I’ve been finding myself younger than I look, sometimes almost a schoolboy:

I’m curious about how a sewing machine stitches, how a bassoon pitches, and how a Space Shuttle lands. 

I need a dictionary to accompany a history book, and often forget the names of those figures and cities one week later.

I couldn’t tell a hyphen, an en dash, an em dash, and a horizontal bar apart until a few months ago.

I’m learning to better convey my thoughts and feelings in the language I speak every day. 

I’m confused by a new foreign language—why there have to be more tenses than what seems necessary.
