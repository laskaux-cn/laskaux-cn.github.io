> Opera, next to Gothic architecture, is one of the strangest inventions of western man. It could not have been foreseen by any logical process. <nobr>. . .</nobr> What on earth has given opera its prestige in western civilisation—a prestige that has outlasted so many different fashions and ways of thought? <nobr>. . .</nobr> I think, because it is <i>irrational</i>. ‘What is too silly to be said may be sung’—well, yes; but what is too subtle to be said, or too deeply felt, or too revealing or too mysterious—these things can also be sung and only be sung. </p>

> So here we are in our sharp, clean, efficient, hygienic century, longing for the old one in our secret hearts. <nobr>. . .</nobr> The romantics give us back our moon, for instance, which science has taken away from us and made into just another airport. Secretly we all want the moon to be what it was before—a musterious, hypnotic light in the sky. <nobr>. . .</nobr> We crave mystery even while we forge ahead toward the solution of one cosmic mystery after the other.  </p>

> We are all still romantics at heart. I think that the world, once bitten by that bug, will never quite be free of the fever, the freedom fever by which we are still so hotly driven. </p>
