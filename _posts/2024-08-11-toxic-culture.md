一封 <span class='num'>1996</span> 年由时任加州理工学院化学副教授 <span class='reg'>Erick M. Carreira</span> 写给自己实验室博士后 <span class='reg'>Guido Koch</span> 的<a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2020/09/06/new-jacs-eic-erick-carreira-correct-your-work-ethic-immediately/comment-page-2/">劝诫信</a>——个人以为具有极高的历史档案价值：

> I would like to provide for you in written form what is expected from you as a member of the research group. In addition to the usual work-day schedule, I expect all of the members of the group to work evenings and weekends. You will find that this is the norm here at Caltech. <nobr>. . .</nobr> </p>

> I have noticed that you have failed to come in to lab on several weekends and more recently have failed in show up in the evenings. Moreover, in addition to such time off, you recently requested some vacation. <nobr>. . .</nobr> I find this very annoying and disruptive to your science. </p>

I receive at least one post-doctoral application each day from the US and around the world. If you are unable to meet the expected work-schedule, I am sure that l can find someone else as an appropriate replacement for this important project. </p>
