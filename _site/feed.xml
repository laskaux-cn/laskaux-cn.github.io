        <title>Rethink the Programmed Life</title>
        <link>/2019/01/06/programmed-life.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">/2019/01/06/programmed-life.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s the first week of a new year. Looking back, historians have attached tags to the distinct epochs of modern history: the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Age, the Information Age, etc. While it’s premature to anticipate what’s coming next, the new millennium does reveal a few signatures, among which is the near-frictionless flow of common knowledge. “Journal” and “encyclopedia” are now more frequently denoting websites than giant volumes in libraries. Tens of languages are being taught online for free. Advanced learning is no longer confined in classrooms. Even elite universities are opening their doors to the middle class and underrepresented groups. The general public have never been so close to understanding and contributing to the frontiers of human civilization. The creativities of our species are being unleashed to an unprecedented extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accessibility of knowledge, together with the improvement in life quality and social equality, should, in principle, prompt a generation-wide desire for independent thinking and pioneering ventures. Yet it is hardly being epitomized by the graduates of higher education institutions in general, including those from the most prestigious universities. Another trend is nevertheless pronounced—standardization. Among my friends pursing non-academic careers, around nine out of ten choose finance, consulting, or information technology, regardless of their backgrounds in college or graduate school. A fraction of those staying in academia—fortunately, not all of them—instead of cherishing the privilege of free inquiry and organized skepticism, seem to be more devoted to the cyclic game of grant-applying, result-producing, publishing, and advertising, to whom solid knowledge is merely a byproduct of their arduous work. Alternative options are occasionally considered as “unconventional” career paths, which may arouse curiosity, if not sympathy, among the ones in “mainstream” industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One has no reason to be disturbed if all these choices are based on clear self-awareness. In fact, a large fraction of them are not. In 1883, when addressing at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, physicist Henry A. Rowland pondered the fate of human creativity in the midst of the Second Industrial Revolution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Man is a gregarious animal, and depends very much, for his happiness, on the sympathy of those around him; and it is rare to find one with the courage to pursue his own ideals in spite of his surroundings. … To-day the railroad and the telegraph, the books and the newspapers, have united each individual man with the rest of the world: instead of his mind being an individual, a thing apart by itself, and unique, it has become so influenced by the outer world, and so dependent upon it, that it has lost its originality to a great extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rowland mourned the past ages of masters, and yet failed to foresee more great minds would emerge in the following century. However, what he pointed out as the suppression of individuality due to ubiquitous connections isn’t far from the truth. But it shouldn’t be simply attributed to the indecisive nature of human minds—through industrialization, a new “cult of progress” was formed, worshiping productivity, fortune, and competition. Followers are supposed to play according to the rules, contributing one’s time and intelligence in exchange for payment and recognition. A reward system was set up, acclaiming those outperforming their peers and elevated along the pyramid. Those reluctant to join are marginalized economically and socially. Nowadays, such systems are governing almost every sophisticated profession—business, technology, politics, law, as well as a substantial portion of academic research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One has to acknowledge that, in almost every aspect, the development of modern society has been greatly accelerated by the cult of progress. But I feel a bit uneasy to see it becoming autocratic—while stimulating the most vigorous minds, it imposes the pressure of abandoning originality and long-term goals for instant success, and evokes a sense of failure to those refusing to do so. Across the intellectual spectrum, pioneering accomplishments are rarely fruits of hypercompetition, opportunism, or populism. Instead, they are more likely to be crafted by genuine passion, determination, and the ability to pinpoint truly significant problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions are left for us to make. As far as I’m concerned, the foundation of education isn’t the acquisition of professional skills, nor the so-called critical thinking and problem-solving, even if they can be well defined. It’s the formation of values—underivable yet influenceable guidelines on what we appreciate and distain, and what motivates us to think and act. If there happens to be a voice yearning for more than a programmed life, why not listen to it and see what it leads to. After all, its chance to survive, given the overall prosperity and openness of the new millennium, should exceed that at any time in the past. And we might be able to taste a pleasure not accessed by many—rather than merely winning or profiting, being how we boastfully call ourselves: &lt;em&gt;sapiens&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Turbulence of Metamorphosis</title>
        <link>/2018/12/09/my-fair-lady.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">/2018/12/09/my-fair-lady.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Fair Lady&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a love story or a princess myth. It is a story of transformation, though perhaps not the one we expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;—Alexis Gargagliano, in &lt;em&gt;Lincoln Center Theater Review&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed. For years, I’d been left the impression of &lt;em&gt;My Fair Lady&lt;/em&gt; being a fairy tale—charming, vibrant, witty, yet too miraculous to be real, too elegant to be affecting—until I walked into the Vivian Beaumont Theater, where I was showered with immense joy and pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lerner &amp;amp; Loewe’s comedy isn’t merely about how individual lives could be reshaped by phonetics in unexpected ways, and it extends beyond a reflection on gender roles and social classes in Edwardian England. At the heart of &lt;em&gt;My Fair Lady&lt;/em&gt; are the elations and tears of the ones wishing to rewrite their fates, and the inherent intellectual strength and emotional weakness of human beings. While laughing and clapping, we might suddenly discover the bittersweet lesson behind the amusing story, the moment we start suspecting if the front curtain is just a mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A considerable fraction of the fascination of &lt;em&gt;My Fair Lady&lt;/em&gt; originates from the straight play it is based on—George Bernard Shaw’s &lt;em&gt;Pygmalion&lt;/em&gt;. But the creativities of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe aren’t secondary—musicalizing &lt;em&gt;Pygmalion&lt;/em&gt; without diluting its linguistic charm and dramatic tension would be a delicate task. Lerner and Loewe did it respectfully—the storyline, characters, and spoken dialogue of their musical are mostly inherited from the play. Consequently, the depth and sharpness of the Shavian classic are very well preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However great the book is, any musical would pale without its score. “‘What is too silly to be said may be sung’—well, yes; but what is too subtle to be said, or too deeply felt, or too revealing or too mysterious—these things can also be sung and only be sung.” The remark by Kenneth Clark in his &lt;em&gt;Civilisation&lt;/em&gt; can’t be better illustrated by &lt;em&gt;My Fair Lady&lt;/em&gt;—when the dialogue takes a breath, music cuts in, amplifying the exhilaration, believes, wishes, prejudice, disdain, or confusion of the roles, then gives the floor back to words. Verbal wits and sensual pleasures constructively interfere, performing a duet that is delightfully serious and seriously delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, music possesses a unique descriptive power. Songs form characters, often nearly define them—the whistling cockneys at Covent Garden, the grumbling servants at 27A Wimpole Street, the aristocratic gathering at Ascot, the mindlessly-in-love Freddy, and—the most vivid of all—Alfred P. Doolittle, the dancing and orating epicurean who can barely afford liquors but not morals. The hero and heroine, however, can’t be delineated even by five songs each. One has to go through every single line to decode the impetus of their fates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-invincible-galatea&quot;&gt;The invincible Galatea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wasn’t noble, but had no fear. She sought from the crowd for witness to protect herself against the mistaken charge. She insisted on checking the “detective’s” notebook to ensure she’s free of accusation. She promised to call the police if being mistreated in the “boarding school.” She greeted a scorning gentleman with the spirit of a true citizen: “I’ve a right to be here if I like, same as you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was poor, but never fell. She never drinks despite her bibulous family. She won’t be tempted by gold and diamonds. She struggled for her lodging, whereas still dreamed of warmth and love. As she constantly reminds herself and the world: “I’m a good girl, I am!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be a huge mistake to think the pre-metamorphosis Eliza merely as a boisterous flowergirl desperate for every tuppence. Although in a less graceful condition, she lived with dignity, discipline, and hope. But nothing could match her knocking on the door of 27A Wimpole Street to negotiate the details of that mocking offer of speech training—she managed to filter out the condescendence, and seize the opportunity to learn and reform. She wouldn’t be easily hurt, but never supplicated. She reasoned that English lessons shouldn’t cost more than French lessons, and yet proposed a tuition that surprised the celebrated phoneticist, considering her limited income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An experiment was launched, but yields unanticipated results: After four months, at the Ascot races, she already acquired a glorious pronunciation, yet didn’t know what to talk. Six weeks later, at the Embassy Ball, she could speak and behave like the most charming princess. The linguistic experiment per se should be called a success. Nevertheless, Eliza is transformed into not a lady but a perfect doll, who can only be manipulated and rely on the kindness of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier on that cold spring night, she sat on a dustcart, picked up cabbage leaves as fans, and sang the sweetest melody in London:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All I want is a room somewhere; &lt;br /&gt;
Far away from the cold night air. &lt;br /&gt;
With one enormous chair; &lt;br /&gt;
Oh, wouldn’t be loverly? &lt;br /&gt;
. . . &lt;br /&gt;
Someone’s head restin’ on my knee; &lt;br /&gt;
Warm and tender as he can be, &lt;br /&gt;
Who takes good care of me; &lt;br /&gt;
Oh, wouldn’t it be loverly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six months later, she sits in a luxurious armchair next to a fireplace, without feeling a bit of warmth. She converses with duchesses, dances with princes, yet not receiving any care. She hurls the slippers at her Professor and escapes from her private school. At Covent Garden, besides the old columns and folks, she hums her &lt;em&gt;Loverly&lt;/em&gt; tune, weeping. She now belongs to nowhere—too genteel to be a flowergirl, yet too weak to be a lady. She gets everything in her dream, but nothing is lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not the end of the transformation. It’s only the beginning, the first step in a new world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She leaves her egocentric and manipulative tutor. She dries her tears and moves on—this time, with an elegant speech and an indomitable heart, which has endured the pains as she learns to tell “Spain” from “Spine,” domination from care, limerence from love, and etiquette from respect. She doesn’t mind evolving into a more cultured Ms. Doolittle, and meanwhile will remain that &lt;em&gt;loverly&lt;/em&gt; Eliza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the making of the fairest lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-vulnerable-pygmalion&quot;&gt;The vulnerable Pygmalion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He lives in his profession. He invents his own universal alphabets and arranges his home like a phonetic laboratory. He can pronounce 130 different vowels and place a person by their accent within six miles in England or two miles in London. To him, an articulate speech is a divine gift from the God:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Think what you’re dealing with. The majesty and grandeur of the English language. It’s the greatest possession we have. The noblest sentiments that ever flowed in the hearts of men are contained in its extraordinary, imaginative and musical mixtures of sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sincerely believes so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world of Henry Higgins is simple and orderly—he uses the laws of linguistics or science in general as the measure of everything. In his mind, humans are classified according to their speeches, and the attractiveness of a person is determined by either their intellectual capacity or the uniqueness of their dialect. He despises anyone who “incarnates insult to English language” regardless of their gender, look, status, or occupation. He has equally low esteem for the uneducated populace and the pretentious, empty-headed nobles. He detests all characters against rationality, independence, and serenity. He is extremely principled, and assumes his principles ought to be obeyed by the whole civilized world. Of course, they aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His contentious beliefs are challenged by Eliza. He can’t understand why the grand success of his experiment leads to her emotional breakdown. Moreover, he observes a strange feeling that has never existed before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was serenely independent and content before we met; &lt;br /&gt;
Surely I could always be that way again—and yet &lt;br /&gt;
I’ve grown accustomed to her looks; &lt;br /&gt;
Accustomed to her voice; &lt;br /&gt;
Accustomed to her face. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Mrs. Higgins’ place, he is defeated by the new Lady Eliza. He encounters his own coldness and arrogance. He is told how hurtful his words and deeds can be, and that he plays nothing but a replaceable role to any living creature. Yet he has no choice but to confess—acknowledging the truth complies with his values more than pretending to be deaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2018 Lincoln Center Theater production ends in an air of melancholy—Eliza enters with her voice played on a gramophone, delivers her famous last line, and exits downstage, slowly disappearing from Higgins’ sight. Note that aisles haven’t been used as exits in interior scenes throughout the show, which, in my opinion, implies Eliza’s last presence is imaginary. In reality, as she promised, she never sees him again. He bids farewell to her—a rare counterpart of him, who truly appreciates his enthusiasm, shares his perseverance, and perceives his frailty. He will start a new chapter of his life, this time, learning to be a human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-transformed-who-are-we&quot;&gt;Being transformed, who are we?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higgins’ lady training program isn’t purely fictitious—in reality, we call it education, the systematic procedure through which young people may change their fates. Many are undergoing a metamorphosis no easier than that of Eliza, especially those pursuing higher education at a prestigious university in a foreign country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now a few years older than Eliza, yet still struggling to accurately pronounce the fifteen distinct vowels in American English: the near-close near-front unrounded /ɪ/, the near-close near-back rounded /ʊ/, etc. I’m rebuilding my vocabulary, using the handbooks intended for teenagers or those without a decent education. I’m assimilating a different set of attitudes and methods in scientific research. I’m resetting my knowledge, especially that on social sciences and humanities. I’m acquiring the basic skills of writing and communication. I’m overhauling my manners and values. There are nights I couldn’t put my books down, either too concentrated or too occupied. There are also “The Rain in Spain” moments, when “at once my heart took flight.” I’m surrounded by enlightening mentorships, as well as aimless zeal. I’ve be constantly encouraged, yet occasionally mocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re exploring a world we’ve never been to. We’re being transformed into someone we aren’t familiar with. We’re approaching thousands of new excitements, yet distanced from many simple joys. We’re gaining knowledge and achievements, but they don’t naturally bring care or love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can spend a night dancing or weeping. But when the morning is smearing up the sky, we’d go back to our phonetic charts, or any endeavor we choose to undertake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, however “ladylike” we’ll become in the coming years, never let the spirit of that vigorous, fearless flowergirl be taken away from us—that’s what launched the transformation, and what essentially powers it. Some day in the future, when hesitating or lost, we shall recall the courage inside us the moment we knocked on the door of our 27A Wimpole Street and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I washed my face and hands before I come. If you were a gentleman, you would ask me to sit down.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Duties of Scientists</title>
        <link>/2018/12/01/the-duties-of-scientists.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">/2018/12/01/the-duties-of-scientists.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are living in an era when scientific research, like trade and manufacture, has grown into a sophisticated social activity—flourishing, dynamic, and highly organized. The thrill of glancing through publications on high-profile academic journals can only be matched by that of watching fluyts sailing into and out of the 17th-century Amsterdam or Model Ts coming off the 1920s Ford assembly line. But the prosperity of science doesn’t provide straightforward answers to two classes of questions: those on the origin of science and those on its destination—namely, &lt;em&gt;why we do science&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;what science is used for&lt;/em&gt;. We’ve been forced to reconsider the relation between science and human society by a series of disconcerting events, which are, in recent years, becoming more perplexing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, it was announced that two gene-edited babies have been born in China. Interestingly, the academia and the market reacted oppositely to this controversial leap: Scientists around the world are overwhelmingly denouncing this clinical application as irresponsible, unethical, and medically unnecessary. But investors seemed to find the smell of success—top stocks on gene-editing technology unanimously traded higher. Accessible information indicates this in-human trial is most likely to be funded by private capital and aimed at commercial interests. And the so-called “unexpected leakage” of results is in fact carefully orchestrated. Notably, this one-year-and-nine-month experiment would be impossible without an interdisciplinary team including experts in gene editing, sequencing, in vitro fertilization, animal testing, financing, and publicity, as well as the participation of an HIV care organization and the permission from medical regulation agencies. All these professionals collaborated quietly and introduced the twins to our world, without realizing the mark they would add to the timeline of human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to me, the Theranos case—first revealed in 2015 and still under investigation—is even more terrifying: a nine-billion-dollar biotech unicorn could be built entirely on deception, and yet had won enormous acclaims—a charismatic young founder, a “revolutionary” blood-testing technology, over 700-million-dollar investment, a board of directors including seven eminent statesmen, and in every aspect, a new Silicon Valley miracle. Science, medicine, business, law, and media—most brilliant inventions of human beings—were maneuvered by their best practitioners to mislead doctors, endanger patients, and defraud investors in the name of ideas, innovations, and “changing the world.” The meticulously designed fraud could be continuing had it not been for an investigative reporter with &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; and a brave young man—the grandson of a Theranos trustee and former US Secretary of State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological hypes have never appeared so frequently while being keenly applauded. What should be condemned aren’t the moral wrongs of a few individuals. It’s a culture, which most STEM students are currently immersed in, that needs to be reexamined—the one that prioritizes &lt;em&gt;what sounds cool&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;what pays more&lt;/em&gt;, instead of finding out &lt;em&gt;what benefits the society in the long term&lt;/em&gt;. We are surrounded by the view that the ultimate goal of scientific research is commercialization. We are being indoctrinated in a narrow definition of success that puts impact, fame, and reward ahead of anything else. We might occasionally find our education distanced from the basic mission of science—to answer, to our best knowledge, &lt;em&gt;what is true&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;what is not true&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;what we don’t know&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I can foresee a tragedy if science is one day dominated by the rules of the business world and loses the values of its own. An often overlooked point is: at the most fundamental level, science reshapes the world not because it makes people more productive, creative, or competitive—though it does—but because while establishing it people learn to be respectful to truths. Outside their laboratories, scientists have to watch closely how the knowledge they created is applied to the real world. They shoulder the obligations to prevent science from being misinterpreted or misused, and to ensure that our greatest intellectual endeavor is serving the common good, or—as a tribute to an old address—of, by, and for the humanity. I say the most irreplaceable role of scientists in the modern society is that of a navigator—leading the crew to catch the ocean currents and avoid the icebergs, and sharing their unbiased information on the best routes for the ship to move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Second Childhood</title>
        <link>/2018/11/18/a-second-childhood.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">/2018/11/18/a-second-childhood.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while I’ve been finding myself younger than I look, sometimes almost a schoolboy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m curious about how a sewing machine stitches, how a horn pitches, and how a Space Shuttle lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m learning to better convey myself in the language I speak every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel more at ease reading a history book with a dictionary, and yet, one week later, I often can’t remember the names of those heroes and cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until a few months ago, I couldn’t tell a hyphen, an en dash, and an em dash apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m puzzled by a new foreign language—why there have to be more tenses than what seems necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is as if I were back to my childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to a new country for graduate school means a lot more than pursing a degree or getting professional training. The elements of my days are different from what I was used to. I’m holding thoughts and attitudes I could never imagine. I’ve been encountering opinions that are the exact opposite of mine, yet closer to the truth. There are moments of exhilaration, as well as of unease and doubt—like what a child would experience in an exotic garden without their parents around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m being taught to explore science as the way nature works, instead of merely as equations and models on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been implanted in my mind that in research, integrity, clarity, and originality outweigh productivity and popularity, as they should always do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve realized that there are more dimensions in one’s education. Science &amp;amp; Engineering is merely one of them. Test preparation isn’t really one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now believe that confidence and vigor are the cornerstones of all achievements, which can only be exhausted by fear and cynicism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m being shown that active communication is the expressway to pleasure, for ourselves and for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essence of childhood is neither innocence nor immaturity. It’s a unique period when a new world is unwrapped in front of us, in which we try, fail, learn, and reform ourselves. It’s less common that an adult has to go through it again. But I am willing to. To me, it’s more fun to watch how much one can change than how much one can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept a diary when I was a kid. Now it’s a good time to resume this habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
